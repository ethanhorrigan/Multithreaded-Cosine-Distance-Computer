### Problems

At first, I made shingles by converting the StringBuilder to hashcodes, I did not find hashCodes easy to work with when debugging the program so I opted for Strings instead.

When taking the shingles and adding into the ConcurrentMaps I found that not all Shingles were being processed, but when I tested the Parser they were being adding to the queue perfectly.
